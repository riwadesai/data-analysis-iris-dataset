1. Consider the iris dataset. It is already there in R library dataset. You can also find this dataset and know about the descriptions of variables in the dataset. Firstly download the data (possibly as a .txt file) and import it into your software.
2. Check whether you have imported the dataset correctly. All variables and observations have been imported and correctly recognised by the soft- ware.
• Make sure that the SpeciesType variable is treated as a categorical variable.
• Produce summary statistics for the imported data file:
– Use these summary statistics to check whether all the variables have been imported correctly.
– Report basic observations, e.g., number of observations, number and nature of variables.
– Report (appropriate) summary statistics for each of the variables.
– For each species type report summary statistics separately for all
3. Consider
the four numeric variables.
the same imported data set.
• Produce a scatter plot of 150 observations on SepalLength and PetalLength.
• Produce separate scatter plots of SepalLength against PetalLength for each of the species types.
• Try to represent these three scatter plots in the same graph (use colors or different symbols to distinguish between different species types).
4. Consider the same imported data set.
• Create the covariance matrix and the correlation matrix.
• Create separate covariance matrices for each of the species types.
• Do you think the covariance matrices vary over different species types.
(Ideally, you should test this statistically. Since, we have not discussed it comment based on your intuitions)
